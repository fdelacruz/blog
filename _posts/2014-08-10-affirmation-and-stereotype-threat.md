*    Commitment   
*    Accomplishment   
*    Compassion   
*    Justice   
*    Spirituality   
*    Self-knowledge

Commitment is very important to me because you need a degree of it in order to accomplish anything in life. Call it grid, call it persintance, but unless you whole-heartedly invested nothing is going to happen.

In general, I try to live up to these values:

*    Commitment: 5 out of 5   
*    Accomplishment: 4 out of 5   
*    Compassion: 4 out of 5   
*    Justice: 5 out of 5   
*    Spirituality: 5 out of 5   
*    Self-knowledge: 5 out of 5  

This my values are what kept at it when the going got rough and at times uncertain. This can definetly help mediating Stereotype threat. Compassion and Spirituality seek to see my brother/sister with eyes of love and recognize that we are closer than we think.
